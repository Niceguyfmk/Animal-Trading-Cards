				<p id="description">Male lions are easy to recognize thanks to their distinctive manes. African lions eat large animals that they find in the grasslands, including antelopes, zebras and wildebeest.
					They work as a group and use intelligent hunting tactics to catch prey which they would not be able to catch alone as they are faster than them.
